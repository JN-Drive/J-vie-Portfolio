### Bridging Gaming Passion with Quality Assurance

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Entertainment and Multimedia Computing from Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, passionate about gaming and game development. With four years of experience in gameplay mechanics and system design, I am now focused on launching my career in Quality Assurance (QA) Testing. My hands-on experience with Unity (C#) and Unreal Engine 5 Blueprinting allows me to understand both the player’s perspective and the developer’s pipeline. I am dedicated to ensuring games run smoothly and delivering the best player experience by identifying issues early and testing thoroughly.
